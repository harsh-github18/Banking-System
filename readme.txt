I have successfully implemented the banking system. With the help of various links and tools in Star UML, I have been able to provide a bank management system. I have been successful in my attempt to take care of the needs of both the customers as well as the administrator. Finally, i hope that this will go a long way in popularizing the organization and helping it work in an organized manner and to keep a track of its deposits, withdraws, loans and other customer related services.

A banking system is a group or network of institutions that provide financial services for us. These institutions are responsible for operating a payment system, providing loans, taking deposits, and helping with investments.
